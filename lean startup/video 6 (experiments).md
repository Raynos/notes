# Experiments

 - An experiment is an educated guess

## Example

 - New feature link / tab
 - Don't show the feature but show the mockup
 - Don't show the feature but show a questionnaire page

This example can fail if

 - No-one clicks the link
 - We build the a similar but wrong thing instead of asking for what users want

## A/B test

Run an A/B test. Run it instead of ask because users lie by accident.

## Show mock before product

Is there any danger annoying customers? No, you can apologize and the negative side effects is outweighted by what you learned.

## Statistical significance?

Yes it would be nice BUT you don't need it. You need to make a judgement on whether A or B is better. In lack of stastical significant you must make the best you can do with the data you have, which is either no choice or arbitary choice.

## Don't debate but experiment & learn

## Validate your assumptions. 

## What to test?

You learn less from little test.

 - When you do radical tests you can get a winner
 - When you do smaller / mediocre tests you get stuck in local maximums

## Daily.io experiment

Send out daily emails. Does not work, people didn't want it. 

 - Do a mocked up experiment
 - Get data
 - Then decide whether to go forward

## Talk to people

Talk about generically the problem space, try to identify the problem, slowly hone in on the thing your trying to solve. Don't inject your own opinion about the problem into the user

## When A/B test failed

Go talk to these users and ask them why they didn't like it or generally talk to them.

## Problem space

Explore the broad problem space of what actual users have. Find a strong pain point that _most_ users have. Get feedback on the early mockup from the target users.
